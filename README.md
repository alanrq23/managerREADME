# Alan's README

Hi, welcome to the team! This readme file is intended to serve as a guideline for you to get to know a bit about myself, it is not intended to replace human interaction and getting to know each other but to give you a glimpse of how I work, think and organize things, hope it helps.
This is a live document and changes are prone to occur.

## About My Role

My top priority is and will always be to have an ever-improving team integrated by members that enjoy what they do, therefore are happy, collaborate, and help each other. 
I will help you set goals that upon completion will improve your technical, leadership, and/or soft skills which in turn will grow your career and help you succeed.
I will make sure you have everything you need including but not limited to equipment, technical blockers, context, etc. If I don’t know the answer to a certain question I will definitely find the person who will.

## Manifesto

I consider myself an avid agilist, which means I take agile values and principles very seriously, I believe in retrospectives, regular feedback and continuous improvement. The following are the core values that I follow, they are not ordered by priority since they can change depending on the situation.
  
  a) Individuals and collaboration over everything else. If you are not well or something is bothering you, do let me know at your earliest convenience so we can work out a solution.
  
  b) Deliver great quality working software. At the end of the day, this is why we are here, and what provides value to the company.
  
  c) Respond to change. If change will help us grow, improve, and above all succeed, it will be more than welcome.
  
  d) Good ideas come from everywhere. Every single one of us can provide suggestions, improvements, ideas, etcetera. You are empowered to provide whatever you can to help the team improve.
  
  e) Transparency and Honesty. I’m committed to the truth, therefore I don’t lie. There might be times in which I might be instructed to wait to communicate something to the team which I will probably do, but under no circumstance will I ever lie to you. Lies are a trigger for me. I will always prefer a harsh truth over a sweet lie.
  
  f) Fail fast, fail often, and communicate it every time.  I will help overcome those failures if I can, find someone if I can’t, and learn from them together. 
                            “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing” – Henry Ford
                            
  g) Respect. Respect each other’s time, arrive on time to all meetings. Be polite, respect everyone.
  
  h) Feedback. This is what allows us to grow and improve both individually and as a team, therefore I will always ask and provide feedback (I will elaborate on this a bit further in the document.)
  
## One-on-one Meetings

We will perform regular one-on-ones starting with bi-weekly 30-minute meetings and we’ll move to more frequent meetings if needed. They are not status meetings, instead, we will discuss career development, strategy, suggestions, problems, etc.  

Even though I will often provide feedback and/or insight on different topics during the meeting, **this is your time**, so if you could spend a couple of minutes preparing before the meeting will be greatly appreciated by both you and me because our meeting will be more agile and we will take more out of it.

The default structure of the one-on-ones is 10 minutes you, 10 minutes me, and 10 minutes both. In the first 10 minutes, you will explain everything you have in mind, in the next 10 minutes I will provide insight or feedback, and in the last 10 minutes, we will both think in action items or things that we can do to improve. This is a loose structure and it can and will be adjusted according to your needs. I like to drink something during these meetings, coffee, water, sometimes even a beer (especially if this is happening on a Friday in the afternoon), feel free to do the same if you want.

I consider myself a succinct person, which means that I will provide direct concise feedback when needed, you will always explicitly know when some adjustment from your side is needed. This does not mean that I will be disrespectful or rude but will be direct. While I appreciate when people try to be this way as well, I do not expect you or anyone else to actually be this way all the time. 

Please don’t wait for this meeting to provide any feedback and/or suggestions you might have, you should look at this as our scheduled time to talk but under no circumstances wait for it to discuss something.

In addition to that, I like retrospectives and how they help teams grow. We will be performing a monthly team retrospective, in which as a team we will provide feedback, and propose different things that we can do to improve always aiming towards continuous integration. I like these to be dynamic so we will be probably using a platform that allows us to have dynamic activities which we all can enjoy. 

## Feedback

We will perform feedback meetings every six months. The first of them you and I will come up with a set of OKRs for you to be completed upon the next feedback meeting.
These are totally intended to help you grow individually and professionally. If performance adjustments are needed from your side or for any reason your job might be at risk I will explicitly state it along with the measures needed to prevent this from happening. As previously stated, my job is to help you grow and succeed not otherwise, so I will do everything I can to help you solve that kind of situation using different techniques like coaching, pair programming sessions, courses, etc.

I will provide a safe environment for you to discuss any topic that you think needs attention. Also, feedback towards my work is welcome during these sessions. Please tell me when I mess up. This is very important because sometimes I don’t notice it and it will likely happen again.

## Availability

My working hours are 8 am - 5 pm but I am always available in Slack, you can ping me 24/7 and I will very likely respond quickly unless I am in the middle of a meeting or something, in which case I will respond as soon as I can. I always respond. If the matter is urgent I would appreciate it if you could clearly state it. 

I do not expect you to be available all the time and I most likely will never bother you outside of your working hours, I'm very disinclined with this which means that if I do, it's an emergency.  This shouldn't happen very often.  It will very likely never happen.

You can always shoot an email, schedule a meeting or call me, I will be willing to help you all the time.

If I reach out to you through a Slack message or email I don’t expect an immediate answer, although this is appreciated I understand there might be more urgent matters to attend to. Please be reasonable.

## How I Work

I am a team player and always aim to have a team in which every member has each other’s back, we display ownership in what we do, collaborate with each other, ask and answer questions, have fun, and overall provide a safe positive environment in which we can all shine, this easier said than done so we will all need your help to achieve it.

I am an engineer as well and technically proficient, it is not rare for me to partake in technical discussions and provide insight, however, I am not better than anyone in the team nor do I intend to, I will always respect the decisions taken by the team, promote research and experimentation if needed and we will all be accountable for what we decide as a team.

I really like retrospectives, we will normally perform retros once a month and after that, we will do something fun as a team, i.e. play a video game (warzone, among us, etc.), hackathons, etc. This kind of event might be seen as a waste of time sometimes but the truth is they help know each other better, create trust and overall build the team up. Please attend to them all the time, we even have some prizes for the winners. 

## About Me

I would like to share a bit of my interests and hobbies in case you want to chat about them sometime.

I really like baseball, my favorite team is the RedSox, I will always enjoy a good chat about baseball (unless you are a Yankees fan hehe). I also like to watch series and movies and play video games if I have the time, that could also be an interesting topic. I also enjoy music, 'Nunca Jamas' and 'Nightwish' are two of my favorite bands.

I always care to know better the people that I work with, if you want to share I will listen as well.

## Disclaimer

Camille Fournier, one of the best thought leaders in engineering leadership does not like Manager READMEs. She states that there will be some glaring blind spots that will inevitably show up in the manager’s behavior vs the document and undermine credibility and trust. Even though I agree with her at some point because we are human beings, not computer programs, I have enjoyed writing this document and put a lot of honest information about my way to do things, but certainly, this cannot englobe all the things that we human beings can do given certain situations.

You can find Camille's article [here](https://skamille.medium.com/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0), in case you want to read more about it.
